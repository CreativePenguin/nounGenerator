# World Star by nounGenerator  
It's a trivia game. Get the high score to own a country.
You will need to know at least basic info about the country that you're
conquering.  
Real life results will vary. Visiting the actual country that you own,
and verifying whether or not it belongs to you is not recommended.
Please do not refer to the people in that country as your subjects.
